# Asteroid-Diameter-Prediction-ML
Our planet has encountered many asteroids with great risk of collision which can cause great damage. Knowing this inspired me to investigate and experiment with data we have on asteroids from NASA through machine learning. 
Created several Machine Learning models to make predictions of the size of a given asteroid through the implementation of Machine Learning models such as Linear Regression, K Neighbours Classifier and XGBoost Regression. 
The project involved exploratory data analysis, pre-processing of the dataset of 400k samples, feature selection, prediction and evaluation. Implemented with Python programming language and utilised Pandas Data frame, Sci-kit Learn, Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries.
